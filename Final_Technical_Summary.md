# Technical Summary: Migration Methods and Rationale

This document summarizes the migration strategies employed for migrating applications, databases, and virtual machines to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and highlights the rationale for each method. The focus is on minimizing downtime, ensuring compliance, and optimizing performance and cost-efficiency.

## Migration Methods

### 1. Hybrid Migration Approach
A hybrid migration approach was employed for critical systems to minimize risks and ensure continuity. This involved rehosting (lift-and-shift) critical systems to GCP while gradually modernizing legacy systems. The rationale was to maintain operational stability while leveraging GCPâ€™s scalable and compliant infrastructure.

### 2. Database Migration to Cloud Spanner
The SQL database cluster was migrated to Cloud Spanner to address scalability, compliance, and disaster recovery challenges. Cloud Spanner's multi-region replication ensured minimal downtime (<4 hours) and provided built-in compliance with GDPR and HIPAA. Real-time replication and schema conversion tools ensured data integrity during migration.

### 3. VM Migration Using Migrate for Compute Engine
150 VMs, both Linux and Windows, were migrated using Migrate for Compute Engine. A phased approach, including pre-replication and off-peak migrations, minimized downtime. Critical workloads were allocated to optimized VM types, balancing cost and performance.

### 4. ERP Modernization with GKE
Legacy ERP systems were modernized by transitioning to a microservices architecture using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This enabled modular scalability and improved disaster recovery while reducing operational costs through containerization.

### 5. Secure Data Migration with Compliance Measures
Sensitive data migration leveraged Cloud KMS for encryption and Cloud IAM for access control. These measures ensured adherence to international compliance standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, while maintaining robust security during and after the migration.

## Rationale for Chosen Methods

- All methods prioritized minimal downtime (<4 hours for critical services) through tools like Database Migration Service, pre-replication of VMs, and real-time data replication.
- Modernization strategies, such as transitioning to Cloud Spanner and GKE, provided horizontal scaling and improved system performance to accommodate global growth and fluctuating workloads.
- Cloud IAM and Cloud KMS ensured data security and compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other international standards. These tools provided encryption, role-based access, and auditability.
- Migration to GCP reduced operational costs by leveraging sustained-use and committed-use discounts, autoscaling, and serverless architectures where applicable.

## Conclusion

The migration strategies adopted for applications, databases, and virtual machines successfully minimized risks, ensured compliance, and optimized performance. By leveraging GCP's robust tools and infrastructure, the organization achieved scalability, operational efficiency, and a future-ready cloud-native architecture.

## Methodology and Justifications for Migration

### 1. Virtual Machines (VMs)
**Methodology**: Migrate for Compute Engine  
**Justification**:  
The phased approach for migrating 150 VMs utilized Migrate for Compute Engine to minimize downtime and ensure a smooth transition. Critical VMs were pre-replicated to GCP to meet downtime limits (<4 hours). This method provided flexibility for both Linux and Windows workloads while ensuring disaster recovery through regional snapshots.

### 2. ERP Application
**Methodology**: Modernization to Microservices on GKE  
**Justification**:  
The ERP application was modernized from a monolithic structure to a microservices architecture hosted on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This approach enabled scalability, better fault isolation, and modular upgrades. Migrating to GKE also allowed leveraging containerization benefits for reduced costs and improved disaster recovery.

### 3. Legacy Mainframe System
**Methodology**: Hybrid Migration and Refactoring  
**Justification**:  
The legacy mainframe system was first rehosted using a lift-and-shift strategy to ensure operational continuity. Gradual modernization followed, breaking the monolith into smaller services using GCP tools such as Pub/Sub for asynchronous communication and Cloud Functions for lightweight, stateless tasks. This hybrid approach minimized risk and downtime while paving the way for cloud-native transformation.

### 4. SQL Database
**Methodology**: Migration to Cloud Spanner  
**Justification**:  
Cloud Spanner was selected for its horizontal scalability, global availability, and compliance capabilities. The methodology included schema conversion, real-time replication, and phased data migration using Database Migration Service (DMS). This ensured data integrity, near-zero downtime, and seamless integration with dependent applications such as ERP and e-commerce platforms.

### 5. E-Commerce Application
**Methodology**: Rehosting and Load Balancing  
**Justification**:  
The e-commerce application was rehosted to Compute Engine with Managed Instance Groups for scalability and reliability. Cloud Load Balancing and CDN were configured to optimize traffic distribution and enhance user experience. This method prioritized performance, cost efficiency, and global accessibility for end users.
